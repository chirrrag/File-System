let input = process.argv.slice(2);

console.log(input);

// in js input is taken via process.argv.slice(2); and slice(2) is taken because in terminal, we type node fileName.js . we so slice(2) because we donot want "node fileName.js" in our file 

// the input is taken in the form of array.. Suppose we type "hey how are you"
// this will be taken as each character in the form of array elements
